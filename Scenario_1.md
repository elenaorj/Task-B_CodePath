Hey Robert,


I want to thank you again for taking some time to meet with me last week. I greatly appreciate your passion in helping us make our vision come true and your willingness to share your knowledge and expertise to our students.

Our goal is to bridge the gap between school and industry through rigorous approach to learning that requires a monumental level of commitment and grit from students. And that would not be possible without the help of mentors like you.

As a mentor, you will help provide context, insights on industry best practices and help guide students as they collaborated on their group project apps.

I just would like to confirm your participation as a mentor for the students of **University of Florida** as previously agreed, so we can have things finalized.  **The 12-week courses that you will be assigned to would run starting Fall of 2018**. We are so excited to have you on board.

For questions, please email us at [support@codepath.org](mailto:support@codepath.org).

All the best,
Tim Lee
CodePath, Co-founder
