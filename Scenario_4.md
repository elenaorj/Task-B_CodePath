Hey there,


Have you ever wanted to play with a new technology and wished that you had other engineers or colleagues to play around with? Had mentors to save you countless hours and guide your learning? Or have you ever wished you had high-quality curriculum projects to make learning more fun?

*Seven million job openings in 2015 were in occupations that required coding skills, and programming jobs overall are growing 12% faster than the market average*. Software engineers are constantly playing catch up with the rapidly changing field of software development. Hence, finding the right place to master your programming skills which also introduces you to the world beyond your textbooks is an essential part of your success.

[CodePath](https://codepath.org/) is an organization that provides *free*, accelerated mobile engineering classes.  The core value that we&#39;re providing is a framework for *highly accelerated learning combining accountability, mentorship, focused curriculum, and peer collaboration on hands-on projects*. The class empowers you to [build iOS apps](http://blog.codepath.com/).

Over the past few years, CodePath has run courses for 1200+ university students across 30+ university campuses. *The courses are built from the same curriculum we used to train professional engineers from top Silicon Valley companies including Facebook, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Yahoo and many more*.

A huge goal of the program is to help students *secure internship opportunities*. Along with the knowledge and skills students learn throughout the course, they *finish the class with an amazing portfolio piece in the form of their group project*.  Students who went through CodePath University both on their own and with our help secured internships at various companies including: Google, Yelp, Apple, Amazon, Slack, Capital One, MakeSchool, State Farm, Philips, Blackstone, Morgan Stanley, Sony and more.

We are excited to continue building and scaling Codepath University *both locally and internationally*. Over the next couple years, you&#39;ll see many more courses added for students across areas like *Android, Web Security, and React*. We will work to bridge the gap not just between industry and universities but also across the socio-economic boundaries.
