Hey there,

Our records indicate that we don&#39;t have your submission for last time's group survey.

A group survey is essential for us to be able to match you with a 3 person group. They will be your teammates in developing your final project and we want to make sure that you are grouped accordingly to maximize your learning process.

Would you still want to continue with the course? If so, please fill out the group survey **within 24 hours after this notice** and [submit it to us](https://courses.codepath.com/sessions) so we can match you to a group already. Failure to do so may result in removal from this course as outlined in our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.com/sessions#heading-assignment-submission). Hope everything is just okay. Please let us know what your plan is moving forward.


Best,
Charlie Hieger
CodePath University Dean
