Hey first_name,



**Seven million job openings in 2015 were in occupations that required coding skills, and programming jobs overall are growing 12% faster than the market average**. Learning to code can be a game-changer. For people looking for a new career, programming skills are in high demand. And even if you’re not looking to shake up your career path, understanding programming languages would give your resume an edge over the competition . Hence, finding the right place to master your programming skills which also introduces you to the world beyond your textbooks is an essential part of your success.

**Are you a type of a person who wants to learn things together with like-minded people? How about having a mentor to save you countless hours and would always be there to guide your learning? Or, a high-quality curriculum projects to make learning more fun?** Don’t worry, we hear you.
